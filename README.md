# Merge Challenge
#### By blackrose9

### 'Funny' Story -> Description
So there is this game I have been playing called Merge Dragons. The general goal is to merge items whether it be trees, flowers, stones or dragons to create greater, more superior items and eventually create a 'Wonder' of the item. 

You need to merge 3 level1 items to create 1 level2 item, though there is a tip in-game that says 'merging 5 instead of 3' this is a very effecient as it allows you to use less resources to get more, as merging 5 level1 items gives you 2 level2 items! Fun!

So this project came as a result of a frustration I had during one of the weekly events, I had unlimited low level items and needed to get to a place of really high level items to comfortable clear the event. So then how many low level items did I need to accumulate to get 1 or 2 high level items? Do you see the mathematical problem here?

So then I thought why not build a program that does just that for me. I tell it how many level6 items I want it tells me how many level1 or level2 items I need.

*Side thought: 
Funny how when I come across an interesting problem my first thought is "I should build a program!" not "let's see if someone else has built a program" 

## Languages
Plain Javascript for now.

### Problems Incomplete / Unsolved
Display how many items I need at each level. Assuming I need a high level item from very low level items. Traverse the user through levels if I can describe it as that.

### Future Works
Make it pretty with a UI and all.
